This project is an attempt to recreate the speech synthesizer built by [Michael Phi](https://youtu.be/YereI6Gn3bM) using research done on other public speech synthesizer repositories and the famous [Deep Speech 2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595.pdf) paper.

This can be considered a part 1 to such a project where the data loader and training architecture have been established, but not yet run and verified.

To use, download (Common Voice Data)[https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets] from their website and run the testTrainSplit.ipynb file, with your own file paths specified

Afterwards, the rest of the work will be in actually getting the training module to function correctly.
